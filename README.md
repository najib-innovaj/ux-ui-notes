# UX/UI Design 

### Theory
What is UX design? You scroll through a website or you tap on a button and something happens. I design what happens. or define yourself as a designer who simply understand your work: I design apps by doing research and what user needs.

### Points
1. Thougts create patterns
2. Patterns create actions and actions become behaviours
3. And behaviour can be studied. And the study of behaviour called pyschology. In UX it's called cognative science. 
### what is Cognative Pyschology? Cognitive Psychology – Definition
The definition of cognitive psychology is deceivingly simple. Cognitive psychology is defined as the branch of psychology devoted to studying mental processes. What may not be so easy to grasp, though, is how many different types of mental processes there are and how people use them in their unique ways to draw conclusions and make decisions. Thus, cognitive psychology encompasses a very broad range of subjects.

- Thinking
- Reasoning
- Judgment
- Attention
- Mental imagery
- Language
- Recognizing numbers
- Memory
- Perception
- Creativity
- Forming concepts
- Making decisions
- Solving problems
- Making choices
- Meta-cognition (thinking about your thinking)
 
### Questions
1. Think about the UI why and how the UX designer distribute the space like the main content or a list, etc.

### UX Design Process
There are four UX design phases
1. User Research/Empathise: We discover users and thier needs here. frustration points, pain points
2. Define: We define users & associated feature set here.
3. Ideate: We draw, sketch, wireframe & design here.
4. Iterate: We test and iterate until we arrive at a greate design. 

### Empathise/User Research
Mindset of creating something that solove "User" problem and their "Needs". Two Major Methods to perform user research: 
1. Qualitative Research
2. Quantitative Research

***Quantitative Research:***
1. We prepare general and specific questionnaires. 2. We do quantitative research when we have minimum budget. We ask general/open ended questions from the client like what are you frustration point/pain point. We send the questionnaires to mass audience (Google, forms, Survey Monkey etc.)
3. We track the feedback & build a report on it by using google docs notion etc to present to the cleint. 
4. We drive conversations based on the finding and engage every possible stakeholder to be on the same page.

***Qualitative Research:***
1. User personas
  - Define personality: name, bio, behaviour, profession. We ll define a particular role of that person in the app.
  - Define Role: Is he using this app by an admin or a general user. 
  - Define Goals: What's his goal to achieve from this app like Ordering pizza is the goal and customer is the role who is using the app.
  - Define Motivations: what motivates the person by using this app for what pleasure he come. 
  - Define Frustrations: what things he get bored or feel frustration from the UX perspective.
  - Get to Specifics: what are the particular requirments for that app you are building. k ess app k lehaz se es user k personality myn kya hona chahye. personlity will be define for every app. like what's the specific of that app or business model ordering pizza that's the specific like requirment main features of the app.   
1. User Research/Empathise: The ability to understand someone elese feelings or thoughts in a situation. Empathy is a tool name. We track what you user say,think does and feels. We can conduct interviews to build an empathy map. We can create empathy map for one or a set of suers. We use the information that comes from emapthy mapping to define our personas.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11480617/182907472-687106fd-6bae-4432-8c64-a02775df3dd8.png)

 - Says
 - Thinks
 - Does
 - Feels
2. ***Define***
     1. When we get to this phase. We already have built an understanding about our users and thier needs.
     2. Now we need to start understanding our brand.
     3. What is the solution our brand / product is going to provide to satisfy the users and their needs.
     4. We define what needs to be done within the constraint of time & cost. 
     5. In the end of the define phase. We have closed requirements & expectations. Now we can get to ideat phase.

3. ***Ideate:*** We finally get to the cool part here. The Design.
   1. We draw user flows, paper sketches / Low fi skecteches.
   2. The valuable asset we produce in this phase is "Wireframes"
   3. Then we take the 'wires' and make high fidelity visual deisgns on tiop of it.
   4. We finally link each screen to prototype.
   5. Low fidility means sketches which draw by hand and high fidility are those which they high visuals. 

4. ***Iterate:*** Now, we have designed. It's time to give it a test drive.
   1. We send our prototypes to the stakeholders and users to test.
   2. We collect the information based on the feedback and reflect the feedback in the next iteration. 
   3. This process is repetitive until we finally arrive at a design.
   4. Iteration is part of the whole UX & UI process. 
5. Jobs to be done framework
6. User journey mapping: User journeys are the step by step journey that a user takes to reach thier goal. This journey will often consist of a number of website pages annd decision points that carry the user from one steop to another.

6. one to one user interviews (zoom, skype, google meet or in-person).
7. What is brain mapping: Let's say you have provided a scenario and trying to understand the scenario or I would simply say understand the whole idea of the client what can be done the client can correct your mistake or the whole idea what he wants. On the basis of Brain mapping we make a flow chart.

***What is sprint:*** A sprint is part of the core components of the agile methodology. The term refers to a predefined span of time in which a team will work to accomplish specific goals. This period may be any length, though sprints are usually fairly short (one or two weeks, for example).

### What makes a good design?
   1. Content is King: Content gives you the context. what is the information that you are designing for. It deponds what's the design about it like app for kids etc then you decide fonts for that. Ask content from the client to make clear the context to design it based on the infromation cient give you. 
   2. Layout: Do research on behance, dribble, pinterst now you have context. 
   3. Form or Shapes
   4. Colours
   5. Typography
   6. Images
   7. Space: Very very important. It's not about you plac e in a design its about what are the spaces you created. It's not about to take in, in the design it's about to take it out from the design and still it looks beautiful.  

# Words of mouth
- Designers in vitnam
- Design muscles mean Analytical + visual design brings creativity not only visual design analytical thinking is important.
1. 🔶 Communicate the Value of Your Work
You're a designer, right?
You know that clients don't care about typefaces, gradients and kerning.
They hired you to take care of that stuff.
What they really want to know is how you can help them make more money.
And the best way to do that is by showing them how your design is going to make their business more efficient and increase profits.
2. ♦️ You have to know how your designs can make money
Here are some examples:
How does this design help users find what they're looking for faster?
How does this design bring in more leads?
How does this design bring in more donors?
3. 🔶 Position yourself as a business owner but be a creator
Take my example, I built my Instagram from 0 to 50K in 8 months, it made me $25,000 personally but generated $245,989 for my agency!
How? I established myself as a UI UX expert on Instagram, companies saw my valuable posts, saw my sponsored posts and offered me contracts which I redirected to my agency!
and agencies charge 3X compared to a normal freelancer,
provide more value and have systems built in!
4. 🔷 Delivering exceptional work!
This year, I worked with a Shopify SaaS product and we completely re-designed their decks, products, and brand! Our deck design helped the company close $5M in funding!!!
The owner had 16 friends whom she referred to me because they were asking, who did your deck!
